Done
- clarify the options
- pop up color for missing file from either folder and change color of character difference, let them choose it
- python log files in detail when exception occurs
- if after select, not select anything, keep the before option, for example output location if not selecting anything then keep the default one
- check jorge file why blank line show up
- give the option to just show the general report, which mean the same and difference only



own personal remaining tasks and others:
- Make it quicker, reduce or eliminate freezing for tinker
- test with all DDs you can find, thoroughly
- look at the logic carefully, think of how it can go wrong, is it bug-proof?
- put line number notice in readme, line number is just suggestive, if anything, please refer to the raw report
- tell in readme that line number is very subjective and explain why
- add to readme trouble shoot to remove and reinstall python
- screenshot installation
- warning in readme if files have more than 100 difference its gonna take a very long time

impact rn:
- comparison tool: make it robust and test it thoroughly
- lock/unlock: finish it up
- testing: find bunches of issues
- find one more project to do that got to do with hardware as well		

Lesson:
- Be careful with global variables
- when edit code, think carefully how it would affect the logic, the flow and the rest of the code
- Be careful with logic, when use if, think about else
- for loop and break
- copy and paste phai doi ten
- can than loi chinh ta, especially dealing with not variable, file input output since the compiler would not be able to notify you
- if you want to truly write a bug-minimal or bug-free code, plan before writing, look at your logic, find a fault in it

improve your skill, reduce bugs as much as possible

to learn:
- what happen when computer debug?


currently working on:
- tkinter freezing
- test with all possible DDs folder found
- look at your own logic and find faults in it
- adding multithreading
